# UI Test Plan

This plan tests the Stewie console application. Tests are run as separate sessions so each case starts with an empty task list.

JUnit coverage and the OS, language, resolution, and scaling matrix are documented in
[the testing guide](README.md). The exact console expectations below use an English JVM locale.
Under a Burmese JVM locale, task-count confirmations use Burmese digits (for example, `၁`);
task dates still use English month names. `CliTest` checks both locale behaviors separately.

## Universal release startup checks

Prepare with Java 25: `./gradlew shadowJar` (PowerShell: `.\gradlew.bat shadowJar`).
The output `build/libs/stewie.jar` contains five isolated platform JARs. Run
`python3 test/check-universal-jar.py` to check every bundled runtime and native CPU type.

- Copy only `stewie.jar` to a fresh writable directory, including a directory
  whose name contains spaces. Run `java -jar stewie.jar` with standard Java 25,
  without JavaFX installed or a network connection. Expect the Stewie window
  and greeting, with no missing runtime, native-library, or architecture error.
- Repeat the same JAR on Windows x64 (including Windows 11 Pro N), macOS Intel
  and Apple Silicon, and glibc-based Linux/Ubuntu x64 and ARM64 with a desktop.
  The JVM architecture determines which runtime is selected.
- Add `todo universal smoke test`, close the window, and check exit status 0.
  Relaunch from the same directory and send `list`: the task must persist in
  `data/stewie.txt` in that directory, rather than in the temporary runtime folder.
- Verify the temporary `stewie-runtime-*` directory is removed after normal exit.
- On an unsupported OS or JVM architecture, expect a clear unsupported-platform
  message and exit status 1, rather than attempting to load incompatible native code.
- Run the existing GUI navigation, persistence, input, and scaling checks with
  the universal JAR on each available platform. Archive checks alone are not GUI tests.

## Windows release startup checks

Prepare with Java 25: `./gradlew windowsJars` (PowerShell: `.\gradlew.bat windowsJars`).
Run `python3 test/check-windows-jar.py` (Windows: `py -3 test/check-windows-jar.py`)
to check the manifest, Windows JavaFX classes, resources, icon services, and x64
PE headers of every DLL. The archive check works on macOS too, but does not prove
that the GUI opens on Windows.

- On Windows 11 x64, including the reported Pro N edition, use a standard x64
  Java 25 JDK without JavaFX. Copy only `build/libs/stewie-windows-x64.jar` into
  a fresh writable directory, open PowerShell there, and run
  `java -jar .\stewie-windows-x64.jar`. Expect the "Stewie — your task studio"
  window and greeting, with no missing JavaFX runtime or native-library error.
- In Chat, send `todo windows smoke test`, then `list`. Expect one unfinished
  task. Close the window; expect `$LASTEXITCODE` to be `0`. Relaunch from the
  same directory, send `list`, and confirm the task was restored. Send `mark 1`,
  then `list`, and confirm the task is completed. Close and relaunch once more
  to verify the completion state persists. Closing must again exit with `0`.
- Repeat with the JAR built on macOS and with the JAR renamed to `stewie.jar`,
  using `java -jar .\stewie.jar`, to cover the original smoke-test command.
- Run the GUI navigation and display-scaling checks below on Windows after
  startup succeeds. Record the exact JDK, OS edition, artifact, and results.
- Build with `./gradlew build` and confirm the Windows and both Linux release
  JARs are created. Run both archive checkers to protect existing Linux packaging.

## Linux release startup checks

Prepare with Java 25: `./gradlew linuxJars`, then run
`python3 test/check-linux-jars.py` to verify both archives and their native CPU types.
These checks supplement the ordered
console sessions; they need a real Linux desktop or an Xvfb display.

- On Ubuntu 22.04 x86-64 with a standard Java 25 JDK (without JavaFX), launch
  `java -jar stewie-linux-x64.jar` from a fresh temporary directory. Expect the
  "Stewie — your task studio" window and greeting, with no missing JavaFX runtime,
  missing native library, or incompatible architecture error. Close the window:
  expect exit status 0. Repeat on another glibc-based Linux distribution.
- On Linux ARM64 with ARM64 Java 25, repeat using `java -jar stewie-linux-aarch64.jar`.
- Build the Linux JARs on macOS as well as Linux. Repeat the relevant startup check
  with the macOS-built artifact, proving packaging does not depend on the build host.
- For each Linux JAR, verify the manifest uses `stewie.ui.gui.Launcher`, JavaFX
  classes and Linux `.so` files are bundled, and no macOS `.dylib` or Windows `.dll`
  files are present. Verify native ELF machine types match the JAR's architecture.
- After successful startup, run the GUI navigation checks below, including adding
  a task, closing the window, and relaunching from the same directory to check persistence.
- On macOS, build with `./gradlew shadowJar` and launch `java -jar build/libs/stewie.jar`
  to check that the shared launcher still opens the existing desktop interface.

## Additional GUI navigation checks

- Launch the GUI from a terminal and add, update, mark, unmark, and delete tasks.
  Show replies in the GUI without printing CLI task confirmations or numbered-command guidance
  to the launching terminal. Running the CLI must retain the exact console output below.

- Add two tasks, enter `list`, then delete the first task. Click a checkbox or delete button
  in the old chat list: show a refreshed list and an out-of-date notice; leave the surviving task unchanged.
  Repeat after an update or a status change. Controls in the refreshed list must work normally.
- Launch a test build without the portrait or stylesheet resources: show a text logo or default JavaFX
  styling and keep command entry working. A corrupt portrait must also fall back to the text logo.


- Start with a malformed or unreadable task file: show the startup warning in Chat.
  Attempt additions, updates, deletion, and checkbox actions: show an error without a success reply
  or a changed task. My List checkbox failures must show a visible error and restore the checkbox.
- Make the file unwritable while the GUI is running and retry a command or card action.
  Restore permissions and retry: save successfully and retain the original data after the failed attempt.


- Verify Chat opens with "Ah, there you are. I'm Stewie." and the supervision greeting.
  Send todo, deadline, event, list, mark, unmark, delete, update, find, help, and bye commands.
  Confirm replies use dry, theatrical phrasing while task cards retain their descriptions, dates, and statuses.
  Completion should say "Completed. Rather well done, actually. Let us not make a scene."
  Bye should say "Very well. Do come back. I mean, someone must supervise your progress."
- Send an unknown command, invalid task number, malformed event/deadline, and invalid date.
  Confirm errors retain usable command guidance; invalid dates begin "A slight flaw in your plan:".
  Search for an absent keyword: show "Nothing matches. Even my brilliance needs a clue. Try another keyword or `list`."
- Verify Help in the sidebar and Chat includes the theatrical introduction and the unchanged command formats.


These manual checks supplement the console cases below. Launch the GUI with Java 25 using `./gradlew run`.

- Verify the sidebar brand and chat header show the Stewie resource image instead of the S logo.
  The whole image should be visible with its original proportions, including after resizing the window.

- Click each suggested command in Chat (`todo plan my week`, `list`, and `help`): immediately send the
  selected command once, show its response, clear the input field, and smoothly scroll to the newest content.
  No additional Enter key or Send click is required. Return keyboard focus to the input field.

- Click Help from Chat and My List: show "Help — Command formats" with formats for todo, deadline,
  event, list, find, mark, unmark, delete, update, help, and bye. Show optional update fields,
  the by/ alias, task numbering, and date examples. Scroll to reach the final example.
- Click Help repeatedly: show one reference and only one active navigation highlight.
  Return to Chat: preserve conversation and unsent input. Enter help: show the same command reference.
- Switch from My List to Help during a completion delay, then return to My List: show the current
  task state without a stale timer changing the displayed cards.
- Click My List with no saved tasks: show the My List heading and
  "No unfinished tasks. Remarkable. Add a task in Chat when ambition returns."
- Add todo, event, and deadline tasks in Chat, then click My List: show unfinished tasks in order,
  including their types, dates, original task numbers, and a circular checkbox on the right.
- Click a completion checkbox: mark that task done and update the sidebar count immediately; dim its card,
  disable its checkbox, and move the card to Completed after three seconds while the GUI remains responsive.
  Complete another task after the first disappears: mark the correct original task, despite the filtered list.
- Complete two tasks one second apart: each card stays dimmed for its own three seconds before disappearing.
  Clicking My List again while already selected must not shorten either delay.
- Switch to Chat during a delay and reopen My List: show the current unfinished tasks; an old timer must not
  remove any newly displayed card.
- Reopen My List and restart the app: completed tasks remain in Completed with checked circular checkboxes. Chat's list command still shows them as done.
- Complete all tasks: show the unfinished empty-state message and all tasks under Completed. Unmark a task in Chat: it reappears in My List.
- Tab to a completion checkbox and press Space: complete the task just as with a mouse click.
- Switch back to Chat: preserve the conversation and any unsent input.
- Change, mark, or delete a task in Chat and reopen My List: show the latest state without duplicate cards.
- Click the selected tab repeatedly: retain one active highlight and one copy of each task.
- With enough tasks to exceed the window height, scroll to reach the last task.
- In Chat, enter `list` with enough conversation history to require scrolling, then check a task:
  append the updated list and smoothly scroll to the bottom over approximately 450 milliseconds,
  easing into and out of the motion so its newest cards are visible without an abrupt jump.
  Uncheck a task in the latest list and verify the same behavior. Repeat after manually scrolling upward.
- Trigger another chat update during scrolling: replace the previous animation and settle at the newest bottom.

- In Completed, uncheck a task: save it as undone, move it immediately to Unfinished, and update the sidebar count.
  Restart the app and verify the task remains unfinished.
- Reopen a completed task while other tasks are dimmed: their individual three-second delays remain intact.
- With no completed tasks, show "No completed tasks yet. I await your first triumph." beneath the Completed heading.

## Shared setup and launch

From the repository root, use Java 25:

```sh
mkdir -p out/ui-test
javac -d out/ui-test $(find src/main/java -name '*.java' ! -path '*/stewie/ui/gui/*')
```

Launch each test case with:

```sh
repo_root="$PWD"
case_dir=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$case_dir"
java -ea -cp "$repo_root/out/ui-test" stewie.Stewie
```

Each case runs in a fresh temporary directory, preserving the real task file.
Run `python3 test/run-ui-tests.py <record-path>` to compile with Java 25 and execute the cases in order.
Optional case setup commands run in that temporary directory before launching the application.
Assertions are enabled with `-ea` to check internal invariants during every session.

The expected output below uses `LF` line endings and includes the final newline produced by the program. The skill may normalize `CRLF` to `LF` and one final trailing newline only.

## Test Case 3: Handle all valid task commands and status changes

### Aim

Verify that todo, event, deadline, list, mark, and unmark commands work together in one session.

## Test Case 10: Preserve valid task data

### Aim

Reject duplicate additions and updates, unsafe descriptions, impossible dates, and invalid event ranges.
Completion status does not permit duplicate details; invalid updates preserve the original task.

### Inputs

```text
todo read book
mark 1
todo read   book
todo other
update 2 read book
update 1 read book
todo bad|description
event trip /from 2026-01-02 /to 2026-01-01
event trip /from 2026-01-01 /to 2026-01-01
